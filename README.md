## üìÅ Project Structure

For a comprehensive overview of the codebase organization, see [Project Structure Documentation](docs/project-structure.md).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### DevContainer (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone and open in VS Code
git clone https://github.com/aindy-eu/django-excel-ai.git
cd django-excel-ai

# Setup environment (required for DevContainer)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY if you want AI features

code .

# Reopen in Container (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Reopen in Container")
# PostgreSQL database will start automatically via Docker Compose
# Then run inside the container:
./dev-start.sh
```

Visit http://localhost:8000

### Local Development

**Prerequisites:**

## üîß Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

- Database credentials
- Secret key
- Debug mode
- Email settings
- AI features (optional)

## ü§ñ AI Features (Claude SDK)

The project includes integration with Anthropic's Claude AI SDK for AI-powered features.

### Setup

1. **Get API Key**: Obtain from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **Configure**: Add to `.env`:
   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   AI_FEATURES_ENABLED=True
   CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
   CLAUDE_MAX_TOKENS=1000
   ```
3. **Test Connection**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test_ai
   ```

### Usage

The AI service is available through `apps.core.services.ai_service.AIService`:

```python
from apps.core.services.ai_service import AIService

service = AIService()
result = service.send_message("Your prompt here")
if result['success']:
    print(result['content'])
```

## üö¢ Production

See [technical documentation](./docs/technical.md#production) for deployment guidelines.

## üéØ Why This Project Exists

Born from a job interview challenge with the cryptic hint: "take a look at Excel." What began as a simple demo transformed into a comprehensive exploration of translating Rails expertise into Django mastery.

This project represents the journey of a Rails developer discovering Django's strengths while maintaining architectural principles that work across frameworks:

- **Modern Django without React/Vue** - HTMX + Alpine.js for 95% less complexity
- **AI that pays for itself** - 625x ROI with intelligent caching (82% cost reduction)
- **Production patterns** - Not theoretical, but battle-tested from real features
- **Clean architecture** - Service layers, proper testing, environment-based config
- **Cross-framework architecture** - Rails principles successfully applied to Django
- **Complete developer experience** - From DevContainer to deployment

## üìà Key Features

### Excel AI Validation

- Upload Excel files via drag-and-drop
- AI-powered data quality analysis in < 3 seconds
- Smart caching reduces API costs by 82%
- Shows actual costs and tokens used
- Force refresh for fresh validation

### Production HTMX Patterns

- Server-side state management (no sync issues)
- Loading states with disabled buttons
- Partial template organization
- Graceful degradation
- CSRF protection that just works

### Developer Experience

- Management commands for testing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Docker DevContainer support
- Modern Python tooling (Black, Ruff, mypy)

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Operation              | Time   | Cost   | Savings |

| AI Validation (Cached) | 50ms   | $0.000 | 100%    |

## ü§ù About This Project

This project serves as a demonstration and learning resource, showcasing:

- How to integrate AI without breaking the bank
- HTMX patterns that actually work in production
- Clean Django architecture from a Rails perspective
- Practical examples over theoretical concepts

**Note:** This is a portfolio/demo project created to showcase Django development skills and architectural patterns. While the code is open for learning and reference, it's not actively seeking contributions.

## üíé Hidden Gems

This project contains more than just Django code.
