# Backlog System - Django Excel AI Validator

> Track and prioritize work systematically

## Workflow

```
backlog.md ‚Üí in-progress.md ‚Üí completed.md
```

## Files

### backlog.md
- **Purpose**: Prioritized list of all pending user stories
- **Format**: Ordered by priority (highest first)
- **Update**: When new stories are added or priorities change

### in-progress.md
- **Purpose**: Track currently active work
- **WIP Limit**: Maximum 3 stories
- **Update**: When starting/pausing/completing work
- **Contains**: Story reference, start date, assigned to, blockers

### completed.md
- **Purpose**: Archive of completed stories with lessons learned
- **Update**: When stories are done
- **Contains**: Story reference, completion date, actual time, lessons

## How to Use

### 1. Starting Work
```bash
# Pick top item from backlog.md
# Move to in-progress.md
# Update status and start date
```

### 2. During Work
```bash
# Update blockers if any arise
# Add notes about challenges
# Track actual time spent
```

### 3. Completing Work
```bash
# Move story files to done/
# Update in-progress.md (remove item)
# Add to completed.md with lessons learned
# Pick next item from backlog.md
```

## WIP Limit Rules

**Maximum 3 stories in progress**

Why?
- Prevents context switching
- Ensures focus
- Identifies blockers quickly
- Improves completion rate

If at WIP limit:
1. Finish current work first
2. Or explicitly pause/blocked one
3. Document why if exceeding temporarily

## Priority Guidelines

### High Priority
- Blocking other work
- User-facing bugs
- Security issues
- Core functionality

### Medium Priority
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Developer experience
- Technical debt

### Low Priority
- Nice-to-have features
- Cosmetic changes
- Documentation
- Refactoring (non-critical)

## Status Indicators

Use these in in-progress.md:

- üü¢ **Active** - Currently working
- üü° **Paused** - Temporarily stopped
- üî¥ **Blocked** - Waiting on something
- üîµ **Review** - Implementation complete, reviewing

## Time Tracking

Track both estimated and actual time:
```markdown
- Estimated: 4 hours
- Actual: 5.5 hours (database migration issues)
```

This helps improve future estimates.

## Lessons Learned Format

When completing stories, capture:

```markdown
### Story: [Story Name]
**What went well:**
- [Positive outcome]

**What was challenging:**
- [Difficulty encountered]

**What we learned:**
- [Key insight for future]

**Time difference:**
- Estimated: X hours
- Actual: Y hours
- Reason: [Why different]
```

## Backlog Grooming

Weekly/Sprint tasks:
1. Review priorities
2. Remove obsolete stories
3. Break down large stories
4. Update estimates based on learnings
5. Ensure top 5 are ready to work

## Metrics to Track

Over time, monitor:
- Average completion time vs estimates
- Common blockers
- Types of work that run over
- Velocity trends

## Integration with User Stories

- Reference story files: `user-stories/todo/001-feature.md`
- Keep story details in story files
- Backlog tracks status and metadata only
- Don't duplicate information

## Tips for Success

1. **Update daily** - Keep status current
2. **Be honest** - About blockers and challenges
3. **Learn from patterns** - Similar stories should improve
4. **Communicate blocks** - Don't stay stuck
5. **Celebrate completions** - Finished work = progress

## Anti-Patterns

‚ùå Starting new work when blocked (communicate instead)
‚ùå Not updating status (creates confusion)
‚ùå Exceeding WIP limit without reason
‚ùå Not capturing lessons learned
‚ùå Keeping zombies stories that won't be done

## Quick Commands

```bash
# See current work
cat .claude/scruaim/backlog/in-progress.md

# Check priorities
head -20 .claude/scruaim/backlog/backlog.md

# Review completed
tail -50 .claude/scruaim/backlog/completed.md
```
