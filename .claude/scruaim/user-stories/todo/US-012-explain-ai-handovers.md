# User Story: Explain AI Handovers

**ID**: US-012
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: TODO
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Value**: High (Continuity)
**Risk**: Low

## Story

**As a** developer working with AI tools
**I want** to understand AI handovers and their impact
**So that** I can maintain continuity across AI sessions

## Background

AI sessions are ephemeral - when you return hours or days later, context is lost. This project used handovers to preserve critical information between sessions, enabling seamless continuation of work. This documentation will show what handovers are, why they matter, and their actual impact on this project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Developer understands what handovers are
- [ ] Developer sees real handover examples
- [ ] Developer learns what information to preserve
- [ ] Developer understands the impact on productivity
- [ ] Developer can create effective handovers
- [ ] Document shows actual project handovers

## Technical Design

### Output File: `docs/tools/ai-handovers.md`

Create a practical guide showing:

```markdown
# AI Handovers: Preserving Context Between Sessions

## What Are AI Handovers?

Context preservation documents that bridge AI sessions

## Why They Matter

[Show productivity impact with real examples]

## Anatomy of an Effective Handover

[Break down actual handover components]

## Real Handovers from This Project

[Show 2-3 actual examples]

## Creating Your Own Handovers

[Practical template and tips]
```

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Discovery Process

Show HOW to explore and understand handovers:

```markdown
## Discovering AI Handovers

### Step 1: Check What Exists
```bash
# Look for handover artifacts:
ls -la .claude/handovers/
cat .claude/handovers/README.md

# Count actual handovers created:
ls .claude/handovers/*.md | grep -v README | wc -l
```

### Step 2: Read Examples
```bash
# Read actual handovers (if any exist):
cat .claude/handovers/handover-*.md | head -100

# Or check the README for structure:
cat .claude/handovers/README.md
```

### Step 3: Analyze Their Impact
- What information was preserved?
- What problems did they solve?
- How did they help continuity?

### What You'll Discover
- Handovers preserve session context
- They document decisions and blockers
- They enable smooth continuation
```

### 2. Document Structure Found

Based on exploration:

```markdown
## What You'll Find in Handovers

### If Handovers Exist

**Date**: 2025-09-17
**Session**: Excel Upload Implementation
**Duration**: 3 hours

#### Work Completed ‚úÖ

- Created ExcelFile model
- Implemented upload view
- Added file size validation (10MB)
- Basic template with HTMX

#### In Progress üîÑ

- Writing upload tests
- Happy path complete
- Need edge cases

#### Decisions Made üí≠

- django-forms over DRF (simpler)
- Sync processing (no Celery yet)
- HTMX for progress (no React)

#### Blockers ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Safari progress bar not showing
- Large files timeout

#### Next Steps üìã

1. Fix Safari issue
2. Add file type validation
3. Complete test suite
4. Add admin interface

#### Key Code Locations üìç

- views.py:45 - Size validation
- forms.py:23 - File handling
- tests.py:67 - Current test
```

### 3. Impact Documentation

Show measurable benefits:

```markdown
## Impact on This Project

### Without Handovers

- 15-30 min ramp-up time
- Duplicate work common
- Decisions forgotten
- Context switching costly

### With Handovers

- 2-3 min to resume work
- Zero duplicate effort
- Decision history preserved
- Smooth continuation

### Real Example

**Session 1** (Thursday):
Implemented user authentication, stuck on email config

**Session 2** (Saturday):
Read handover, immediately knew:

- Email config was the blocker
- Console backend was the solution
- Tests were partially written

Result: Productive within 2 minutes
```

### 4. Best Practices

From actual experience:

```markdown
## What Makes a Good Handover

### Essential Elements

‚úÖ Current story/task
‚úÖ Git branch name
‚úÖ Test status
‚úÖ Next concrete action

### Helpful Additions

üìù User preferences discovered
üìù Failed approaches (don't repeat)
üìù Performance considerations
üìù Code line references

### Common Mistakes

‚ùå Too vague: "Worked on features"
‚úÖ Specific: "Implemented US-006 Excel upload, stuck on Safari"

‚ùå No next steps: "Feature incomplete"
‚úÖ Clear path: "Next: Fix Safari, then add type validation"
```

### 5. Template and Guide

Provide actionable template:

````markdown
## Your Handover Template

```markdown
# Handover - [Date] [Time]

## Session Context

- Story/Task:
- Branch:
- Duration:

## Completed ‚úÖ

-
-

## In Progress üîÑ

-
- % complete:

## Decisions & Rationale üí≠

- Chose X because Y

## Blockers/Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

-
- Attempted solutions:

## Next Steps üìã

1.
2.

## Key Locations üìç

- file.py:line - description
```
````

### Quick Creation Tips

1. Write handover BEFORE ending session
2. Be specific about locations
3. Include "why" for decisions
4. Make next steps actionable

````

### 6. Project Examples

Include real handovers:

```markdown
## Actual Handovers from This Project

### Handover: AI Integration Challenge

**Context**: Implementing Claude API integration
**Challenge**: Cost control for large Excel files

**What the handover preserved**:
- Token counting approach
- Preview mode decision
- Rate limiting strategy
- Test data locations

**Impact**: Next session implemented solution in 1 hour vs estimated 3 hours

[Include 2-3 more examples]
````

## Testing Plan

Validate documentation by checking:

- Are handover benefits clear?
- Can reader create their own?
- Do examples demonstrate value?
- Is template immediately usable?

## Success Metrics

Documentation succeeds when:

- Reader understands handover value
- Reader can write effective handovers
- Examples show real productivity gains
- Template gets used in practice

## Out of Scope

- Scruaim framework details (US-011)
- Analysis generation (US-013)
- AI collaboration patterns
- Session management tools

## Notes

Focus on practical impact and real examples. Show how 5 minutes writing a handover saves 30 minutes next session. Include actual handovers from this project to demonstrate value.
