# User Story: Explain Scruaim Framework

**ID**: US-011
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: TODO
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Value**: High (Educational)
**Risk**: Low

## Story

**As a** developer exploring this project
**I want** to understand the scruaim framework and its review process
**So that** I can see how stories drove this project systematically

## Background

This project was built using the scruaim framework - a lightweight agile methodology for AI-assisted development. Every feature started as a user story, went through rigorous review, and was systematically implemented. This documentation will show the framework in action with real examples from this project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Developer understands what scruaim stands for
- [ ] Developer can trace features back to their stories
- [ ] Developer sees how reviews ensured quality
- [ ] Developer learns from real project examples
- [ ] Developer can apply scruaim to their own work
- [ ] Document is practical, not theoretical

## Technical Design

### Output File: `docs/tools/scruaim-framework.md`

Create a comprehensive guide showing:

```markdown
# The Scruaim Framework: Story-Driven Development in Action

## What is Scruaim?

A lightweight agile framework designed for AI-assisted development:

- **S**tory-driven development
- **C**ollaborative with AI
- **R**apid iterations
- **U**ser-focused outcomes
- **A**rchitecture-aware
- **I**ncremental delivery
- **M**etrics-driven

## How It Works: The Pipeline

### 1. Draft → Todo → In Progress → Done

[Show actual story progression from this project]

### 2. The Review Process

[Explain STORY-REVIEW.md with real examples of what it caught]

### 3. Real Examples from This Project

[Show 2-3 stories and their journey]

## What Made It Work

[Practical lessons from using scruaim]
```

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Discovery Process Section

Show HOW to explore and understand scruaim:

```markdown
## Discovering the Scruaim Framework

### Step 1: Explore the Structure
```bash
# See what's in the scruaim folder:
ls -la .claude/scruaim/

# Read the main documentation:
cat .claude/scruaim/README.md
cat .claude/scruaim/user-stories/README.md
cat .claude/scruaim/user-stories/INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

### Step 2: Understand the Review Process
```bash
# Learn how quality was maintained:
cat .claude/scruaim/user-stories/STORY-REVIEW.md

# See what reviews accomplished:
cat .claude/scruaim/backlog/completed.md
cat .claude/scruaim/backlog/backlog.md

# Explore project reviews and analysis:
ls .claude/reviews/
cat .claude/reviews/*.md
```

### Step 3: Trace the Story Pipeline
```bash
# See completed work (exclude current todos):
ls .claude/scruaim/user-stories/done/
cat .claude/scruaim/user-stories/done/US-006-*.md

# Understand the flow:
# draft/ → todo/ → in-progress/ → done/
```

### What You'll Discover
- Framework definition in README
- Story templates in INSTRUCTIONS
- Review checklist that caught issues
- Real examples in done/ folder
```

### 2. Document What They'll Find

Based on their exploration:

```markdown
## What You'll Learn from the Files

### From .claude/scruaim/README.md
- Scruaim acronym meaning
- Django-specific patterns
- Workflow stages
- Testing approach

### From STORY-REVIEW.md
- 175-line checklist
- Enterprise standards
- Red flags to avoid
- PRM compliance rules

### From completed.md
- 7 stories implemented
- Actual metrics achieved
- Real challenges faced
- Lessons learned

### From .claude/reviews/
- Point-in-time project analysis
- Architecture decisions captured
- Progress snapshots
- Quality assessments

### From done/ stories
- How stories evolved
- Actual implementation time
- Decisions documented
- Patterns that emerged
```

### 3. Analysis They Should Perform

Guide them to discover insights:

```markdown
## Analysis to Perform

### Count the Evidence
```bash
# How many stories completed?
ls .claude/scruaim/user-stories/done/*.md | wc -l

# How many still todo?
ls .claude/scruaim/user-stories/todo/*.md | wc -l

# What's the average story size?
grep "Effort:" .claude/scruaim/user-stories/done/*.md
```

### Find Patterns
- Which stories took longer than estimated?
- What review points appeared most?
- What decisions were documented?

### Connect Features to Stories
- Find Excel upload in the app
- Trace it back to US-006
- See how it evolved from draft to done
```

### 4. Create Summary Document

After exploration, document findings:

```markdown
## docs/tools/scruaim-framework.md Structure

### Part 1: What I Discovered
Document what you found by exploring the files

### Part 2: How the Framework Works
Based on README and INSTRUCTIONS

### Part 3: What the Reviews Accomplished
From STORY-REVIEW.md and backlog files

### Part 4: Real Examples
From done/ stories showing the process

### Part 5: How to Apply It
Practical guide based on templates found
```

### 5. How to Apply Scruaim

Practical guide for developers:

```markdown
## Using Scruaim in Your Project

### Quick Start

1. Create `.claude/scruaim/` structure
2. Copy STORY-REVIEW.md checklist
3. Start with one story in draft/
4. Review rigorously
5. Implement systematically

### Templates Provided

- User story template
- Review checklist
- Handover format

### Tips from Experience

- Keep stories under 8 hours
- Review before coding
- Document decisions
- Capture lessons learned
```

## Testing Plan

Validate documentation by checking:

- Can a developer understand the framework?
- Can they find the story for any feature?
- Do the examples make sense?
- Is it actionable, not just theory?

## Success Metrics

Documentation succeeds when:

- Reader understands the framework
- Reader sees the value of systematic development
- Reader can apply scruaim to their work
- Examples are clear and relevant

## Out of Scope

- Detailed AI collaboration patterns (separate story)
- Handover process (US-012)
- Analysis generation (US-013)
- Generic agile theory

## Notes

This story focuses on the framework and review process only. It shows how systematic development with stories led to successful project delivery. The key is showing real examples, not theoretical concepts.
