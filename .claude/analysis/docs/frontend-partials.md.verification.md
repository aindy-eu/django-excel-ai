- Force refresh pattern implemented exactly as documented
- Context passing patterns followed in all views

### Django Template Patterns
- Include patterns work exactly as documented
- Conditional includes used throughout navigation
- Field partial pattern used in forms
- Dark mode classes consistently applied
