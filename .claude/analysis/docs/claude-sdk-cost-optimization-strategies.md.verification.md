## Detailed Verification

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED
| Line | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 15-17 | Claude Sonnet 4 pricing and typical validation cost | Matches current pricing and AIValidation.cost calculations | ‚úÖ |
| 31-42 | Caching implementation code | Pattern matches ValidateWithAIView in views.py | ‚úÖ |
| 63-75 | get_preview_data implementation | Matches ExcelUpload.get_preview_data method | ‚úÖ |
| 86-96 | Optimized prompt structure | Matches validation prompt pattern in implementation | ‚úÖ |
| 250-257 | Implemented features checklist | All features verified in codebase | ‚úÖ |
| 259-267 | Future enhancements list | Clearly marked as not yet implemented | ‚úÖ |
| 45-48 | Cache metrics and impact | Reasonable estimates based on caching logic | ‚úÖ |
| 50-57 | Cache duration strategy table | Matches business logic requirements | ‚úÖ |
| 77-83 | Token reduction techniques | Matches data sampling implementation | ‚úÖ |
| 154-159 | Model pricing comparison table | Matches current Anthropic pricing | ‚úÖ |

### ‚ùå FAILED
| Line | Claim | Reality | Action |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 244 | "Dynamic model selection" listed as implemented | No model selection logic found in codebase | Move to "Future Enhancements" |
| 243 | "Dynamic model selection" in results | Not actually implemented | Remove from "After Optimization" |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è OUTDATED
| Line | Claim | Current | Update |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 237 | "Single model (Opus)" in before optimization | Should specify actual starting point | Clarify baseline scenario |

### üÜï MISSING
| Feature | Location | Should Document |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Actual cache hit rate measurement | Implementation | How cache rates are calculated |
| Response time optimization | Performance | Impact of caching on user experience |
| Error handling costs | Error scenarios | Cost of failed validations |

## Corrections Applied
- Line 244: Moved "Dynamic model selection" from implemented to future enhancements
- Line 243: Removed "Dynamic model selection" from optimization results
- Added note that percentages are projections based on implemented optimizations
