### ❌ FAILED
| Line | Claim | Reality | Action |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 31-32 | Coming Soon: components.md and alpine-patterns.md | These files don't exist | Remove "Coming Soon" section or create files |

### ⚠️ OUTDATED
| Line | Claim | Current | Update |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 41 | "Heroicons-style SVG icons" | Templates use inline SVG but no heroicons imports found | Clarify icon strategy |

## Missing Documentation Opportunities
| Feature | Location | Should Document |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Avatar Upload Component | static/js/alpine/components/avatarUpload.js | Component exists but not documented |
| Excel Upload Component | static/js/alpine/components/excelUpload.js | Component exists but not documented |
| HTMX event debugging | Multiple templates show hx-on: events | Advanced debugging patterns |

## Corrections Applied
None - documentation is highly accurate overall.

## Recommendations
1. Remove "Coming Soon" section or create the mentioned files
2. Document the avatar and excel upload Alpine.js components
3. Clarify icon strategy (inline SVG vs Heroicons library)
4. Consider adding a troubleshooting section for common HTMX issues
