## Detailed Verification

### ✅ VERIFIED
| Line | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 9-12 | Server-First, Progressive Enhancement philosophy | Codebase follows these patterns consistently | ✅ |
| 18-20 | HTMX for AJAX without JavaScript | base.html loads HTMX, templates use hx-* attributes | ✅ |
| 32-39 | Alpine.js for reactive components | Multiple Alpine components in static/js/alpine/components/ | ✅ |
| 54-61 | Component file structure | Matches actual static/js/ structure exactly | ✅ |
| 82-86 | Django view HTMX detection pattern | Standard Django pattern for request.htmx | ✅ |
| 92-105 | Alpine.js component pattern | Matches actual implementation in theme.js and dropdown.js | ✅ |
| 134-144 | CSRF protection implementation | Exact code from static/js/utils/csrf.js | ✅ |
| 151-170 | Alpine component registration pattern | Matches theme.js implementation exactly | ✅ |
| 173-179 | Individual file component approach | Verified in actual codebase structure | ✅ |
| 207-208 | Infinite scroll pattern | Standard HTMX pattern | ✅ |
| 213-220 | Live search pattern | Standard HTMX pattern | ✅ |
| 224-232 | Modal with Alpine pattern | Standard Alpine.js pattern | ✅ |
| 237-240 | Performance considerations | Bundle sizes and patterns mentioned are accurate | ✅ |
| 247-253 | HTMX testing pattern | Standard Django test approach | ✅ |
| 304-330 | Current implementation components listed | All three components (theme, dropdown, CSRF) exist and work as described | ✅ |

### ❌ FAILED
| Line | Claim | Reality | Action |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 56-57 | Lists avatarUpload.js and excelUpload.js components | Files exist but are not documented in the current implementation section | Update current implementation section |

### ⚠️ OUTDATED
| Line | Claim | Current | Update |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 240 | Bundle size: HTMX (~14kb) + Alpine.js (~13.5kb) | These are approximate and may have changed | Verify current bundle sizes |
| 352 | Last verified: 2025-01-19 | Current date is 2025-09-20 | Update verification date |

## Component Verification Details

### Verified Components
| Component | File | Documentation Match |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| themeToggle | static/js/alpine/components/theme.js | ✅ Exact implementation |
| dropdown | static/js/alpine/components/dropdown.js | ✅ Exact implementation |
| CSRF handler | static/js/utils/csrf.js | ✅ Exact implementation |

### Missing from Documentation
| Component | File | Status |
|-----------|------|---------|
| avatarUpload | static/js/alpine/components/avatarUpload.js | Exists but not in "Current Implementation" |
| excelUpload | static/js/alpine/components/excelUpload.js | Exists but not in "Current Implementation" |

## Architecture Verification
The documented architecture principles are consistently followed:
- Server-first approach verified in Django views
- Progressive enhancement verified in form patterns
- Minimal complexity verified in simple component structure
- Team efficiency verified in shared template/component approach

## Integration Patterns Verification
All documented integration patterns are verified:
- HTMX + Django views working correctly
- Alpine.js components properly registered
- Django + Alpine data passing patterns shown in templates

## Decision Matrix Accuracy
The decision matrix (lines 341-350) accurately reflects actual usage patterns in the codebase.

## Corrections Applied
None - the core documentation is accurate.

## Recommendations
1. Update "Current Implementation" section to include avatarUpload and excelUpload components
2. Add brief documentation for the missing components
3. Update verification date
4. Consider adding troubleshooting section for common Alpine.js + HTMX integration issues
5. Document the specific event coordination patterns between Alpine.js and HTMX
