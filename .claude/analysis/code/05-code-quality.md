### Code Complexity

#### File Size Analysis
```python
# Largest files (lines of code)
493 lines: excel_manager/views.py        # Could benefit from splitting
331 lines: excel_manager/tests/test_ai_validation.py
283 lines: users/tests/test_avatar_upload.py
250 lines: authentication/tests/test_auth.py
228 lines: excel_manager/models.py

# Total application code: 4,233 lines
```

#### Code Organization
```python
Classes defined: 85
Functions defined: 207
Average class size: ~50 lines
Average function size: ~20 lines
```

## Code Comments Analysis

### Technical Debt Markers
```python
TODO comments: 1
FIXME comments: 0
HACK comments: 0
XXX markers: 0

# Single TODO found:
"TODO: Update to use consistent pattern with other apps"
Location: apps/excel_manager/admin.py
```

## Code Patterns Found

### Good Patterns
```python
# Consistent use of class-based views
LoginRequiredMixin for authentication
Factory pattern for test data
Service layer for AI integration
Environment-based configuration
```

### Anti-patterns Detected
```python
# Unused imports (11 instances)
# Unused variables (10 instances)
# One bare except clause (error handling issue)
# Large view file (493 lines) needs refactoring
```

## Dependency Quality

### Direct Dependencies (requirements/base.txt)
```python
Django >= 5.1           # Latest LTS version ✅
psycopg[binary] >= 3.2  # Modern PostgreSQL adapter ✅
django-allauth >= 65.0  # Actively maintained ✅
django-htmx >= 1.19.0   # Current version ✅
Pillow >= 10.4         # Latest stable ✅
openpyxl >= 3.1        # Excel processing ✅
anthropic              # Official SDK ✅
```

### Development Dependencies
```python
pytest >= 8.3          # Latest testing framework
pytest-cov >= 5.0      # Coverage reporting
pytest-django >= 4.9   # Django integration
factory-boy >= 3.3     # Test data generation
black                  # Code formatting
ruff                   # Fast Python linter
mypy                   # Type checking
djlint                 # Template linting
```

## Type Checking Results

### MyPy Analysis
```bash
# .mypy_cache/ directory exists
# Type hints usage found in:
- apps/core/services/ai_service.py
- Type annotations: Optional, Dict, Any

# Missing type hints in most views and models
```

## Code Duplication Analysis

### Potential Duplications
```python
# Login required pattern repeated in all views
class SomeView(LoginRequiredMixin, TemplateView)

# Similar form handling in multiple views
- ExcelUploadView
- AvatarUploadView
# Could be abstracted to mixin

# Test setup duplication across test files
- User creation patterns
- Authentication setup
```

## Security Code Review

### Good Practices Found
```python
✅ CSRF protection enabled
✅ LoginRequiredMixin on all sensitive views
✅ Environment variables for secrets
✅ SQL injection protected (Django ORM)
✅ XSS protection (Django templates)
```

### Potential Issues
```python
⚠️ One bare except clause (hides errors)
⚠️ DEBUG flag management needs review
⚠️ No rate limiting found
```

## Performance Indicators

### Database Queries
```python
# No obvious N+1 query patterns found
# Using select_related/prefetch_related not verified
# No raw SQL queries detected
```

### Caching
```python
# No caching implementation found
# No Redis/memcached configuration
# Could benefit from view caching
```

## Code Maintainability Score

### Positive Factors (Score: +7/10)
- ✅ High test coverage (86%)
- ✅ Consistent project structure
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Factory pattern for tests
- ✅ Service layer abstraction
- ✅ Environment-based config
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured

### Areas for Improvement (Score: -3/10)
- ❌ Unused imports/variables (22 issues)
- ❌ Large view file needs splitting
- ❌ Missing type hints in most files

### Overall Maintainability: 7/10

## Recommended Refactoring

### Priority 1 - Quick Fixes
```bash
ruff check --fix apps/      # Fix imports/variables
black apps/                # Format code
```

### Priority 2 - Structure
```python
# Split excel_manager/views.py into:
- views/upload.py
- views/detail.py
- views/validation.py
- views/management.py
```

### Priority 3 - Type Safety
```python
# Add type hints to:
- All view methods
- Service layer interfaces
- Model methods
```

### Priority 4 - Performance
```python
# Implement caching for:
- User profile queries
- Excel file metadata
- AI validation results
```
