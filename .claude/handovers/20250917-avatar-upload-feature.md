# Handover: Avatar Upload Feature - 2025-09-17

## Context & Goals
- **What we were working on**: Implementing US-005 Avatar Upload Feature with HTMX and drag-drop support
- **Why this matters**: Complete user profile functionality with modern UX for file uploads
- **Key constraints**: 5MB file size limit, image-only (jpg/jpeg/png/webp), HTMX for seamless updates
- **Success criteria**: Users can upload/replace avatars via drag-drop or click, with instant preview and automatic old file cleanup

## Key Decisions Made

- **HTMX Pattern Replication**: Followed EmailManagementView's exact HTMX pattern rather than creating new approach. This ensures consistency across the codebase.

- **Separate AvatarUploadForm**: Created dedicated form instead of handling in ProfileUpdateForm because:
  - Cleaner validation logic
  - Easier to test in isolation
  - Better separation of concerns for HTMX partial updates

- **Django Signal for Cleanup**: Used pre_save signal instead of model save() override because:
  - Ensures cleanup happens regardless of how model is saved
  - Django best practice for file cleanup
  - More reliable than overriding methods

- **Alpine.js for Drag-Drop**: Chose Alpine.js (already in project) over vanilla JS because:
  - Consistent with existing interactive components
  - Cleaner declarative syntax
  - Built-in reactivity for preview updates

## Discoveries & Insights

- **User Model Structure**: User model has `first_name` and `last_name` moved to UserProfile for GDPR compliance. Tests needed adjustment to account for this.

- **Profile Auto-Creation**: Django signal automatically creates UserProfile when User is created. Tests expecting manual profile creation needed updates.

- **Image Validation Pattern**: Using `get_image_dimensions()` from Django catches malicious files better than just checking extensions.

- **HTMX Response Strategy**: Returning `_profile_info_card.html` on success (not the form) provides better UX - shows updated avatar immediately.

## Current State

- **Completed**:
  - ✅ AvatarUploadForm with comprehensive validation (size, type, malicious file detection)
  - ✅ AvatarUploadView following HTMX patterns
  - ✅ Drag-drop interface with Alpine.js
  - ✅ Instant preview before upload
  - ✅ Automatic cleanup of old avatars
  - ✅ Dark mode support throughout
  - ✅ 17 comprehensive tests (all passing)
  - ✅ Profile info card shows avatars with fallback initials
  - ✅ URL routing configured
  - ✅ Documentation of approach

- **In Progress**:
  - Nothing - feature is complete and tested

- **Not Started**:
  - Image optimization/resizing (could be future enhancement)
  - Crop functionality (could be future enhancement)

## Django-Specific Sections

### Model Design Choices
- **Avatar field on UserProfile**: Keeps User model clean, aligns with PII separation strategy
- **Signal-based cleanup**: More reliable than model methods for file deletion
- **ImageField vs FileField**: ImageField provides built-in validation

### Form Architecture
- **ModelForm approach**: Leverages Django's built-in validation
- **Custom clean_avatar()**: Multi-layer validation (size → extension → actual image)
- **Form inheritance**: Separate form maintains single responsibility

### View Patterns
- **FormView + ModelForm**: Clean pattern for handling file uploads
- **HTMX detection**: `hasattr(request, 'htmx')` pattern consistent across views
- **Partial template returns**: Different templates for GET (form) vs POST success (card)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Immediate**: Feature is complete - ready for code review and merge
2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add image optimization (resize large images automatically)
   - Add client-side cropping before upload
   - Add upload progress indicator for slow connections

## What Files Don't Show

- **Why signal over model method**: Signals ensure cleanup even if save() is bypassed or bulk operations used
- **Why separate form**: ProfileUpdateForm was getting too complex; separation improves testability
- **Test factory adjustments**: Had to move first_name/last_name from UserFactory to UserProfileFactory - not obvious from model definitions alone
- **Failed attempt**: Initially tried to return the form template on success - bad UX, switched to returning profile card

## For Next AI/Human

- **Start here**: `apps/users/views.py` AvatarUploadView to understand the flow
- **Key context**:
  - User model uses email auth, no username field (but attribute exists as None)
  - UserProfile is auto-created by signal when User is created
  - Names (first/last) are on UserProfile, not User (GDPR compliance)
- **Watch out for**:
  - Don't add first_name/last_name to User model or UserFactory
  - Profile already exists when User is created (signal handles it)
  - Use UserWithProfileFactory for tests needing both User and Profile
  - HTMX views must return partials, not full pages

## Test Coverage Details

The test suite covers:
- **Security**: Authentication required, CSRF protection, malicious file rejection
- **Functionality**: Upload success, file validation, old file cleanup
- **Edge cases**: Large files, invalid types, HTMX vs regular requests
- **UI flows**: Drag-drop, preview, form errors

All tests use pytest with Django test client, following project conventions.

## Implementation Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~350 (including tests)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of new code paths
- **Patterns Reused**: 4 (HTMX view, form validation, Alpine component, signal cleanup)
- **New Patterns Introduced**: 0 (full consistency with existing codebase)
