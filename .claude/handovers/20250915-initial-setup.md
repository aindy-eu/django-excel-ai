# Handover: Initial Framework Setup - 2025-09-15

## Context & Goals
- **What we were working on**: Setting up .scruaim framework and AI handover system
- **Why this matters**: Establish systematic development workflow with proper knowledge preservation
- **Key constraints**: Django 5.1+, PostgreSQL, enterprise-ready architecture
- **Success criteria**: Framework ready for user story creation and AI context preservation

## Key Decisions Made

- **Chose .scruaim over generic agile**: Tailored specifically for AI-assisted development with clear folder structure. Generic templates would miss Django-specific patterns.

- **Enterprise architecture from start**: Split apps/, libs/ structure even though project is small. Easier to establish patterns early than refactor later.

- **US-XXX naming convention**: Standardized on US-001 format for user stories instead of just numbers. Provides clarity and searchability.

- **No Django Admin in production**: Decision already made to use custom backoffice views. Admin only for local development.

## Discoveries & Insights

- **Project is evolving architecture**: Files were modified during setup showing active development:
  - INSTRUCTIONS.md enhanced with enterprise patterns
  - README files updated with security/GDPR considerations
  - Dashboard view cleaned up with better comments

- **GDPR compliance built-in**: Framework includes PII encryption placeholders and audit trail requirements from start

- **Testing strategy defined**: pytest-django chosen over unittest, security tests mandatory

## Current State

- **Completed**:
  - .scruaim framework structure created
  - User story templates with Django-specific sections
  - STORY-REVIEW checklist with production gates
  - INSTRUCTIONS.md with actual code patterns
  - Backlog system with WIP limits
  - AI handover system integrated
  - .gitignore updated for handovers

- **In Progress**:
  - None - setup complete

- **Not Started**:
  - First user story creation
  - Authentication app setup (referenced in modified files)
  - Backoffice app implementation
  - Field encryption library
  - Testing framework setup

## Django-Specific Sections

### Database Schema Decisions
- **PostgreSQL required**: Using PostgreSQL-specific features planned (JSONField, ArrayField)
- **Custom User model**: Must be implemented early (Django best practice)
- **Audit trail**: Each model should track created_at, updated_at minimum

### Authentication & Security
- **django-allauth configured**: Already in INSTALLED_APPS
- **Split auth app planned**: Separate authentication app from users app
- **PII encryption**: Field-level encryption for GDPR compliance (libs/encryption)
- **No credentials in code**: Using django-environ for all secrets

### Performance Optimizations
- **Query optimization focus**: select_related/prefetch_related patterns documented
- **Static files**: Whitenoise for production, Tailwind for CSS
- **WIP limit of 3**: Prevent context switching in development

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Immediate**: Create first user story for authentication app setup
2. **Next**: Implement custom User model before any other models
3. **Future**: Set up pytest-django and initial test structure

## What Files Don't Show

- **Why enterprise structure now**: Team expects growth, better to establish patterns early
- **Backoffice decision**: Django admin deemed insufficient for business users
- **PRM emphasis**: Previous projects suffered from code duplication, hence 2+ rule

## For Next AI/Human

- **Start here**: `.claude/scruaim/user-stories/README.md` to create first story
- **Key context**: Files were actively modified during setup - project is evolving
- **Watch out for**: Don't use Django admin for production features, always use US-XXX naming for stories
