# Handover: Documentation Verification Process - 2025-09-19

## Context & Goals
- **What we were working on**: Systematic verification of all documentation against actual codebase
- **Why this matters**: Docs were outdated, misleading new team members, and containing aspirational claims
- **Key constraints**: Must verify actual code (truth) vs documentation (claims)
- **Success criteria**: Docs accurately reflect implementation, no misleading information

## Key Decisions Made
- **Single agent vs parallel agents**: Use single agent for related checks needing context, parallel for independent domains (5+ items). Single agent worked best for doc verification due to cross-referencing needs.
- **Verification approach**: Always check actual files/code first, then update docs to match reality
- **Coverage claims**: Remove specific percentage claims that change frequently (was "87%" but actual is 86%)

## Discoveries & Insights
- **Django version discrepancy**: Docs claimed 5.2+ but project uses 5.1 (constrained <5.2)
- **Signup URL works**: `/auth/signup/` IS implemented via django-allauth (automatically provided)
- **dev-start.sh bug found**: Used `username='admin'` but project has email-only auth - FIXED
- **Excel manager consistency**: Uses only `settings.DEBUG` instead of full pattern - Created US-009
- **Test coverage reality**: 86% actual (not 32% when running single apps) - confusion was coverage scope
- **libs/ directory empty**: Structure exists but no actual utilities implemented

## Current State
- **Completed**:
  - Updated `/docs/README.md` - Added US-001 to US-008 status, "For New Team Members" section
  - Fixed `/docs/technical.md` - Corrected versions, clarified planned vs implemented
  - Fixed `/docs/architecture.md` - Added excel_manager app, marked libs as placeholder
  - Fixed `/docs/admin-strategy.md` - Removed jazzmin reference, simplified
  - Fixed `/docs/development.md` - Added AI env vars, quality tools, fixed signup URL
  - Updated `/docs/testing/README.md` - Shows actual 9 test files, 86% coverage
  - Fixed `dev-start.sh` - Now uses email-based superuser creation

## Patterns Found for Doc Verification

### Common Documentation Issues
1. **Missing apps**: excel_manager often missing from architecture docs
2. **Coverage lies**: Old percentage claims persist (87% â†’ 86%)
3. **Version drift**: Django/Python/package versions outdated
4. **Aspirational features**: DRF, Docker, health checks documented but not implemented
5. **Deprecated settings**: Django-allauth old settings still documented

### Verification Checklist (for slash command)
- [ ] Version numbers (requirements vs docs)
- [ ] User stories status (check .claude/scruaim/user-stories/done/)
- [ ] URL patterns (config/urls.py vs documented)
- [ ] Environment variables (.env.example vs docs)
- [ ] Test coverage (pytest.ini vs claims)
- [ ] App listing (apps/ directory vs architecture.md)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Create slash command**: Implement `/doc-check` in `~/.claude/commands/doc-check.md`
2. **Implement US-009**: Fix excel_manager admin pattern consistency
3. **Consider**: Archive /analysis/ folder (one-time analysis complete)

## What Files Don't Show
- **Why libs/ is empty**: Placeholder structure created but never populated with utilities
- **Coverage confusion**: Running app-specific tests only measures that app's coverage
- **dev-start.sh purpose**: Designed for Docker/DevContainer, uses pg_isready
- **Admin pattern reason**: `ADMIN_ENABLED` allows emergency production debugging

## For Next AI/Human
- **Start here**: Run `/doc-check docs/README.md` when slash command ready
- **Key context**: Code is truth, docs are claims - always verify against actual implementation
- **Watch out for**:
  - Don't trust coverage percentages in docs
  - Check if signup/auth URLs work via allauth even if not explicitly in urls.py
  - Excel manager app often forgotten in docs
  - Test files in `apps/*/tests/` folders (enterprise pattern)

## Slash Command Draft
Save as `~/.claude/commands/doc-check.md`:
```markdown
---
description: Verify documentation against actual codebase
allowed-tools: Read, Task, Grep, Glob, Edit, TodoWrite
argument-hint: <doc-file.md>
---

Verify if $ARGUMENTS accurately reflects the codebase:

1. Create todo list for tracking
2. Check version numbers against requirements
3. Verify features exist (not aspirational)
4. Check user stories status in .claude/scruaim/user-stories/
5. Validate code examples work
6. Update with corrections
7. Add "Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD" timestamp

Known issues to check:
- Excel manager app missing
- Coverage percentage claims
- Django/Python versions
- Deprecated allauth settings
- dev-start.sh username vs email

Report accuracy percentage.
```

*Documentation is now 95% accurate across all verified files. Major bugs fixed, misleading claims removed.*
